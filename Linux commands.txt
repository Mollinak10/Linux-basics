Hi everyone! 
Welcome to Linux basic commands. You’ll learn how to navigate in Linux using the command line. 

Getting started
LINUX 
I’ll be using Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS on my windows desktop. You can also download the previous versions of Ubuntu. The command lines and prompts will be usable on earlier and future versions as well. 
While setting up your username keep in mind to use underscore (_) and set up a simple password like your name or 1234. 

Structure 
After setting your username and password, you will see something like this on the screen:  
molly_k@DESKTOP-MBJ059:~$
You might see $ or # depending on your system. Here “molly_k” is my username. 
You need to be careful about being case-sensitive while working on Ubuntu. 
A and a are not the same thing! So, keep this in mind while working. 

NAVIGATION
How to navigate like a pro! 
You need to know a few basic navigation commands to find your way while working. 

mkdir 
mkdir i.e. make directory is used to create a new directory.
You can choose any name for your directory. Here I’m using linux (directory name). 
~$ mkdir linux

ls 
ls is used to list down all the content. It gives you a list of directories, comes in handy when you’re using multiple directories.
~$ ls
linux
cd 
cd stands for change directory which literally means to change directory. When you have multiple directories, you can use cd to open other directories and navigate between them. 
~$ cd linux
~/linux$ 

cd ..
Now, if you want to go back a step, you can use cd .. 
~/linux$ cd ..
~$

pwd
pwd (print working directory) which shows the current directory i.e. the folder you are currently in. Since, the name of the directory is linux the command line shows full address like below. 
~/linux$ pwd
/home/molly_k/linux

nano 
Do you want a text file with content? Use nano to create a text file. 
~$ Nano mk.txt
1. A new window will open. 
2. Type your text. And press ctrl + X
3. Press the Y key on the keyboard for Yes.  
4. Press enter-key and you’ll be back to your main page. 
rm 
To remove files, you can use this prompt. 
But be careful while using rm! 
~$ ls 
linux   mk.txt
~$ rm mk.txt 
~$ 

rmdir 
rm alone is not enough to remove directories, you need to use rmdir which is to remove (empty) directories  
But be careful while using rmdir! 
~$ mkdir linux
~$ 

cat 
To see the text content of your text file you can use this command.
~$ cat mk.txt
My name is Molly. 
~$

echo
It prints out whatever you type. 
~$ Echo “hi molly” 
hi molly 



grep 
If you want to search a particular word from the contents of a file you can use grep. 
~$ grep “name” molly.txt 
My name is Molly. 

See you for the next lesson!
